				<h3>Organic Ranking of Search Results:</h3>
				<p> As mentioned previously, organic search ranking refers to search result that are not influenced by paid advertising on search engine indexes. These results are ranked according to how well search elements are applied through the website. To go further into depth, search engines have algorithms that are designed to take account these factors and elements in order to establish relevancy when doing a general search on search engines such as Google.  Factors that influence search rankings include:</p>
				<li> Content Quality </li>
				<li> Backlinks </li>
				<li>Mobile User Experience </li>

				<p><u>Content Quality</u></p>

				<p>When designing a website it is important to have well curated and optimized content. Content takes form of anything that is displayed though the site. Words, titles, images, navigation, footer, structure and so on. “If the users are happy and spend a decent amount of time reading the content, Google bot will assume the content is useful, well-written, visually-appealing, easy to read, and possesses all other attributes of a quality content.” [1]</p>

				<p><u>Backlinks</u></p>
				<p> Backlinks, also known as incoming links, are links from another website to a page or homepage for another site, in this case World Maid Clean.  Google’s Search Quality Senior Strategist, Andrey Lipattsev, admitted that the backlinks are one of three key main factors that influence sears ranking in their companies algorithms.[2] It is vital to have backlinks in order for your page to rank.</p>

				<p><u>Mobile User Experience</u></p>
				<p> As with backlinks, mobile user experience will be further developed in the report. To summarize, a larger portion of users access the Internet by their mobile devices. With this portion increasing everyday, it is important to have a website that is mobile friendly in all aspects. Millers law, a user experience motion, establishes that the average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.[3] So, with mobile websites, it is crucial to have a simple, straight forward website.</p>

				<h3>Keywords and Current Ranking:</h3>

				<p><u>Keywords</u></p>

				<p>Keywords, also known as search queries, are the words people type into search engines to find a website they are looking for. Keywords are important for making sure to highlight content that people are searching for and avoiding content that they are not. A study from Ahrefs states that, “Many website owners make the mistake of creating content that is not being searched for and is likely the reason why 90.63% of pages get no traffic.”[4] </p>
				<p>A good way to begin research for keywords would be to define keyword within the niche of your business and to look at what keywords get traffic to your competitors’ websites. Some good ways to find niche words would be different internet groups and forums such as reddit. This can also give different problems and perspectives about your business that you may not have known about. </p>
				<p>Another way of being able to generate useful keywords for your website is to use different research tools for keywords. It is important to be able to filter out words that get an extensive number of searches for newer websites because they tend to be more competitive. A good strategy would be to find some keywords that are not searched as much to make your website more competitive with that keyword. </p>
				<p>After utilizing Wordtracker.com we learned which keywords to implement with this website and keywords to avoid. Some keywords to not focus on would be simple words that are associated with maids such as:</p>

				<li> House cleaning  </li>
				<li> Maid </li>
				<li>Maintenance  </li>

				<p>Since these words have high volume, or average number of searches per year, making them competitive within the online maid business. The keywords that we think be important to utilize would be:</p>

				<li> Airbnb cleaning  </li>
				<li> Rental cleaning</li>
				<li>Rental property maintenance </li>

				<p>The rental property scene has grown significantly especially with the app Airbnb which lets anyone rent out their houses and properties to guests. This also could establish a niche connection with World Maid Clean and Airbnb property owners as well as other current or future online rental businesses. </p>

				<p><u>Current Rankings</u></p>

				<p>Ranking defines the position of a website within a search through a search engine. Ranking is important for being able to control and track the amount of traffic a website retains. High ranking websites tend to directly correlate with a higher chance of a searcher clicking on that website. </p>
				<p> Searchmetrics.com states, “The relationship between rankings and clicks is strongest amongst the top 3 search results.”[5] There are multiple factors that relate to rankings other than keywords such as:</p>

				<li> The number of backlinks  </li>
				<li> Sitemaps</li>
				<li>Internal linking </li>

				<p> Overall, this website does not seem to rank very high with specific keywords that it should such as cleaning, weekly cleaning, and remote maid on Semrush.com. We noticed that over the past couple of months WorldMaidClean.com has gotten more traffic. From September to October the website was able to traffic in about <b>800</b> visits and from December to January about <b>2000</b> visits.</p>

				<h3>Analysis of Current Web Pages:</h3>
				<p>We think something the website has done well is establish a specific geographic location. In addition, they could try to advertise harder to the specific highly populated areas they clean such as Dallas and Fort-Worth and Arlington. We believe that worldmaidclean.com should try to implement some new keywords to continue to boost traffic on their website and to also try to create different niches within their market, such as stated earlier to boost their traffic. </p>

				<p><u>SWOT Analysis</u></p>

				<p><b>Strenghts:</b></p>
				<li>Online presence of the website.</li>
				<li>Clear description of cleaning system.</li>

				<p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p>
				<li>Customers must fill out estimates</li>
				<li>Could potentially create a subscription service depending on house-size and square footage</li>

				<p><b>Opportunities:</b></p>
				<li>Potentially add of 24-hour cleaning service</li>
				<li>Creating a niche amongst Airbnb users</li>

				<p><b>Threats:</b></p>
				<li>Other maid services with larger user base</li>
				<li>New advancements in home cleaning devices</li>

				<h3>Inbound Links and other SEO recommendations: </h3>
				<p>To expand on this, Backlinks, also known as incoming links, are links from another website to a page or homepage for another site. “Google and other major search engines consider backlinks “votes” for a specific page. Pages with a high number of backlinks tend to have high organic search engine rankings.”[6] When other websites backlink your sites page, this tells search engine algorithms that this certain website is important, thus increasing the organic search ranking. </p>
				<p>The Backlink Audit tool, provide by SEMRUSH is an effective tool to use in order to analyze backlink health for a website. The World Maid Clean site, resulted in a poor audit. The total number of referring domains for World Maid Clean (the total number of active referring domains that have at least one link leading to the analyzed domain) was: <b>35</b> </p>
				<p> Competitors in the Dallas-Fort Worth for World Maid Clean such as The Miracle Cleaning and The Cleaning Authority, have a total referring domain amount of: <b>75</b> and <b>2,314</b> respectively.</p>
				<p> Compared to The Miracle Cleaning and The Cleaning Authority, World Maid Clean comes short in backlink referring domain to The Miracle Cleaning and is dwarfed by The Cleaning authority.</p>
				<p>There are different ways to improve inbound links for your website. Those being:</p>

				<li>Comparing your website with competitors and looking at where their inbound links are coming from</li>
				<li>Comment on related blogs and increase posting on public forums or social media</li>
				<li>Get listen in relevant directories, such as the yellow pages, portfolio sites or vendors lists </li>
				<li>Producing quality content </li>

				<p> To summarize: Moz, a SEO agency, says that, “In essence, backlinks to your website are a signal to search engines that others vouch for your content. If many sites link to the same webpage or website, search engines can infer that content is worth linking to, and therefore also worth surfacing on a SERP (search engine results page). So, earning these backlinks can have a positive effect on a site's ranking position or search visibility.”[7]</p>

				<h3>Traffic Boosting Ideas:</h3>

				<p><u> Social Media Presence:</u></p>
				<p>“Social media allows for immediate interaction and customer feedback. Businesses can also respond to their customers right away. With nearly half of U.S. customers using social media to ask questions about products or services, having a social media customer service strategy is extremely important.”[8] Brady Dukart says. With social media being a huge part of the lives of many people. Having a steady and large presence in social media networks like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter can help you reach a larger audience. </p>
				<p>According to Pew Research Center survey, around 72% or 7-in-10 of adult Americans have a social media presence.[9] Using social media metrics can be useful in certain demographics. Including but not limited to age groups, geographic location and to some extent their income. This can help you establish a business plan that can be used to maximize the company’s presence. For example, we believe that targeting certain age groups could be an angle to take in order to establish marketing techniques that is adapted for that certain age group. Using the Pew Research Center’s data, the most popular social media network in the United States is Facebook.[10] The largest age group to use Facebook by percentage is the group of 30-49. [11]  Using this data, it can be cross-referenced to the the data provided by iProperty Management that give us the homeownership rate by age. The age group 30-49 home ownership is 59.4% [12] , this data can be used since the company focuses on residential cleaning service. The company should target the age group of age 30-49, as they have the largest presence on Facebook and have a home ownership around 60%.</p>
				<p>Another advantage for social media is the ability to quickly connect with current and future customers. According to Sprout Social: “40% of consumers expect brands to respond within the first hour of reaching out on social media, while 79% expect a response in the first 24 hours.”[13] If the company maintains a steady and efficient connection between clients, loyalty can be established between the business and consumer. Having a quick response time with clients and customers can give you a competitive advantage. According to recent Sprout Social data, “44% of consumers also say customer service distinguishes a brand from its peers.”[14] To place bow on this traffic boosting strategy, using social media can be deemed necessary in today’s age to stay afloat as a business. Smart and tactical strategies involving social media will lead to a more success for World Maid Clean. </p>

				<p><u>Mobile Usibility</u></p>

				<p> Having a website that is mobile compatible is vital for a website to be successful. According to Courtney Boyer from Charley Grey, “Desktop traffic has steadily decreased over the last decade as customers turn to their mobile devices for their internet needs. Recent studies have shown that more than 50% of online traffic now comes from mobile devices or apps. This statistic varies based on industries, but on average businesses see anywhere from 25-60% of their online traffic coming from mobile devices.”[15] </p>
				<p> Using Google’s Page Insight Tool, the mobile version website for World Maid Clean is poor. Landing at a score of 23 out of 100, using the Lighthouse Performance Scoring system that Google provides. The LPS take in account different time metrics in order to give out a score, such as: The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive and the time it takes for large images and text to be displayed.</p>
				<p>It is suggested to improve this score by completing certain steps. Those steps are:</p>
				
				<li>Enabling text compression. Estimated time savings: 8.25 seconds </li>
				<li> Removing unused CSS. Estimated time savings: 6.7 seconds</li>
				<li>Remove unused Javascript. Estimated time savings: 2.25 seconds</li>
				<li>Efficiently encoded images. Estimated time savings: 0.9 seconds</li>

				<p> Taking these steps will lead to a more efficient mobile website where customers can browse the company’s website and leave with a satisfying experience. </p>
